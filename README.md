# Challenge 2 - Adjoa's Portfolio

So far, I have used the flow of code from the first challenge to help guide me during this challenge. I am also googling where to put position the text. I tried using wireframe.cc but I felt like was not as helpful because I already had an idea of where I wanted everything to go. The CSS portion of this challenge is the most difficult.
