# Challenge 2 - Adjoa's Portfolio

# Description
The purpose of this challenge is to create an engineering portfolio to showcase our  previous - and upcoming - projects. 


# How I created the portfolio
I wish I could create time stamps for when and how much I worked on this challenge. I would spend all day/everyday figuring out the layout and positioning of images and text and then break the code and then quit at 5am for a few hours of rest. The most challenging part of this assignment is feeling like I am submitting something that is absolutely not my best work and is incomplete. 

To start off, I tried using the flow of code from the first challenge to help guide me. I also searched where to position the text. I tried using wireframe.cc but I felt like was not as helpful because I already had an idea of where I wanted everything to go. The CSS portion of this challenge was the most difficult. 

I did some web searches for a few examples of portfolios and saw one that I loved - please see below. It looked so smooth and simple. Little did I know how difficult that creating a veritical navigation bar, having an image with text layered on top, and an image gallery with my projects would be.

I went back and forth with the CSS and HTML code, trying to figure out what to use i.e. sections, figures, z-index, id vs class, divs, figcaption vs paragraph, etc. I left a lot of code that is now commented out in the CSS file - some of the code I accidently deleted before I remembered to comment it out. 

This project is NOT complete yet and I will come back to it. I am determined to redeem myself and turn in an assignment that I am proud of.

# What did I learn?
I learned just how much it takes to create a website and that engineers spend a lot of hours building projects. 

# Credits
Please note that my TA and instructor did help me with some of the code that is written in the CSS and HTML file - particularly for the images within the "My Projects" and "Other Projects" section when I was having difficult figuring out the code for layout of the page.
